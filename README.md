## Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of modern technologies to ensure robustness and scalability:

- **Programming Language:** PHP (Specify version, e.g., PHP 8.1)
- **Backend Framework (if any):** (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, or custom MVC structure)
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Database:** (Specify type, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB - and version if relevant)
- **Package Managers:**
  - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/): For PHP dependencies (e.g., `aws/aws-sdk-php`).
  - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)/[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): For JavaScript dependencies (e.g., `tailwindcss`).
- **Web Server:** (Specify type, e.g., Apache, Nginx - and version if relevant)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
- **Other Tools/Libraries:**
  - [AWS SDK for PHP](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/): For interacting with Amazon Web Services (if used for services like S3, SES, etc.).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- PHP (Specify required version, e.g., >= 8.0)
- Composer (Latest version recommended)
- Node.js and NPM/Yarn (Latest LTS version recommended)
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or use PHP's built-in server for development)
- A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Git

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    cd Restaurant-Service
    ```

    _(Replace `https://your-repository-url.git` with the actual repository URL)_

2.  **Navigate to the Source Code Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd "source code"
    ```

3.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4.  **Install JavaScript Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Or using Yarn
    yarn install
    ```

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    - Locate the environment configuration file. This is often an `.env.example` file that you need to copy to `.env`. (e.g., `cp .env.example .env` or create `.env` manually).
    - Update the `.env` file (or the relevant configuration file, e.g., `app/core/config.php`) with your local environment settings:
      - Database connection details (host, port, database name, username, password).
      - Application URL.
      - API keys (if any).
      - Other environment-specific settings.

6.  **Set Up the Database:**

    - Create a new database for the application (e.g., `ecommerce_db`).
    - Import the database schema. If a `.sql` dump file is provided (e.g., `database/schema.sql` or `database/migrations`), import it into your newly created database.
      ```bash
      # Example for MySQL
      mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < path/to/your/schema.sql
      ```
    - Run database migrations if the project uses a migration system (e.g., `php artisan migrate` for Laravel).

7.  **Build Frontend Assets (Tailwind CSS):**

    - Check `package.json` for build scripts.

    ```bash
    # Example build command (check your package.json)
    npm run build
    # Or for development with watching changes:
    npm run dev
    # Or a direct Tailwind CLI command (if not using npm scripts):
    npx tailwindcss -i ./public/css/input.css -o ./public/css/style.css --watch
    ```

8.  **Configure Your Web Server:**

    - Point your web server's document root to the `source code/public` directory.
    - Ensure URL rewriting is enabled (e.g., `mod_rewrite` for Apache) to handle `.htaccess` files for clean URLs.
    - **For Apache:** You might need to configure a Virtual Host.
    - **For Nginx:** Configure a server block.

9.  **Set File Permissions (if necessary):**
    - Certain directories (e.g., `storage`, `cache`, `uploads`) might require write permissions by the web server.
    ```bash
    # Example (use with caution, adjust to your server's user)
    # sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage/
    # sudo chmod -R 775 storage/
    ```

## Running the Application

Once the installation is complete:

1.  **Ensure your web server (Apache/Nginx) is running.**
2.  **If you are using PHP's built-in server (for development only):**
    Navigate to the `source code/public` directory and run:
    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```
3.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the URL you configured (e.g., `http://localhost/Restaurant-Service/source%20code/public/` or `http://your-local-domain.test` or `http://localhost:8000`).
